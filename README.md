# PHSX815_Project2

Project 2 focuses on comparing two hypotheses. 

All Data Generation and Analysis was done using **Hypothesis.py**. **Random.py** defined functions for a Poisson and Gamma Distribution. **MySort.py** defined a sorting function to sort lists.

The LaTeX Report is shown in **PHSX_815_Project_2.pdf**. It describes the Null Hypothesis, the Alternative Hypothesis, how the two hypotheses were compared, and includes all graphs + excerpts of code.
